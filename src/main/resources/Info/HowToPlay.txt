If you are playing for the first time, it is better to play offline for practice. "Newbie" type in offline mode is specially designed for practice. To know all control keys, please go to "Settings --> Control". For learning purposes, you can just see how computer players win or lose by setting 0 human players in the "Normal" type. When you are ready, you can play either in online or offline mode. Note that in both modes, there is no 'pause' option! You can just close the game.

Each player needs to survive and defeat other players. The last survival will be the winner. You can take some strategic roles to survive (such as putting bombs in the places where more players can be defeated). Beware that your own bombs can destroy you too!

In online mode, up to 4 players can play the game simultaneously via a network (such as WLAN, LAN or the Internet). One player needs to create a game either by peer-to-peer (P2P) or by client-server (CS) connection type. P2P connection type is preferable when possible. Other players need to join the game via the player's IP address. Computer players can play in online mode too. For connection via ISPs, note that if different players use different ISPs, they may not connect each other. For more help or troubleshooting, please see the documentation of your operating system and the programs you use for networking purposes.
